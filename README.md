### Olá 👋

I'm Pedro Ramos, a Computer Science and Information Systems student 🎓 who loves coding and learning new things 📚. Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer intern at Dock 💼, where I'm focusing on backend development.

👨‍💻 My tech stack includes Java, Spring framework and T-SQL. Although, I also had adventures myself with a little bit of Node.js, React.js, Python, some NoSQL and more 🛠️. I'm also a Linux user and passionate about open-source software 🐧. In fact, I'm looking for ways to contribute to the community and expand my knowledge, so let me know if you have some ideas I could help with 🤝.

If you'd like to connect or learn more about my experience, feel free to check out my LinkedIn profile 🌐: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-ramos-b6b179129/. Let's code together! 💻
